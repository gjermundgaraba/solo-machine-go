# solo-machine-go


## Potential roadmap

- [ ] Basic solo machine with built-in relayer and ICS20 support
- [ ] External state machine support (separate the solo machine state from all the plumbing - i.e. build your own state machine/whatever)
- [ ] Multi-chain support
- [ ] Multi-sig support
- [ ] More IBC application support
- [ ] External relayer support? (undecided if this even makes sense)
